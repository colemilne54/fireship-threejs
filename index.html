      <h2>üìú Manifesto: The Human-Centric Software Developer</h2>
      
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        As a software developer, I have always believed that technology is a means to an end, and that end is to empower, 
        enable, and elevate the human experience. While I am a people person at heart, I have found that I also have a knack
        for software development. This unique combination of skills has allowed me to understand the true potential of technology and its 
        ability to make a significant impact on the world. My extroverted nature has led me to prioritize human connections and e
        mpathy in my work, and I firmly believe that humans should always come first in the development process.
      </p>

      <h4>The Human-Centric Approach</h4>
      <p>
        The human-centric approach is the cornerstone of my software development philosophy. This involves understanding 
        and empathizing with the end-users of the technology I create, ensuring that their needs, goals, and experiences 
        are at the forefront of every decision I make. This means designing and developing software that is not only 
        efficient and effective, but also engaging and intuitive.
      </p>

      <h4>Collaboration and Communication</h4>
      <p>
        As a people person, I understand that the most successful projects are built through collaboration and effective 
        communication. I am committed to fostering an environment where all team members feel heard, valued, and encouraged 
        to share their ideas and perspectives. This collaborative approach helps create stronger, more resilient software  
        that meets the diverse needs of its users.
      </p>

      <h4>Accessibility and Inclusivity</h4>
      <p>
        Inclusivity and accessibility are non-negotiables in my work. I strive to create software that can be used by everyone, 
        regardless of their abilities or background. By focusing on accessibility, I can create products that are more useful, 
        more engaging, and ultimately, more impactful.
      </p>

      <h4>Continuous Learning and Improvement</h4>
      <p>
        The technology landscape is ever-evolving, and I am committed to staying informed and adapting my skills accordingly. 
        I believe in the importance of continuous learning and improvement, and I am always seeking opportunities to expand my 
        knowledge, both in technology and in human-centered design.
      </p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        As a human-centric software developer, I vow to always put people first in every project I undertake. I am passionate 
        about harnessing the power of technology to improve lives, and I am dedicated to creating software that is accessible, 
        engaging, and truly impactful. My portfolio showcases the projects and collaborations that embody these values, and 
        I invite you to explore them to learn more about my work and my commitment to putting humans at the heart of software development.

      <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

      <p>
        I am proud to have achieved a number of significant accomplishments throughout my academic and extracurricular career.
        As a recipient of the WICHE WUE (Western Undergraduate Exchange) Scholarship, I have demonstrated a strong commitment 
        to academic excellence and have been recognized for my achievements in pursuing higher education.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been actively involved in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity, where I have 
        held various leadership positions and contributed to the organization's success. As the New Member President in Fall 2021, 
        I helped guide new members through the process of joining the fraternity and ensured that they felt welcomed and supported. 
        As a Recruitment Committee Member in Spring 2022, I worked to attract new members to the organization and helped to build
        a strong community within the fraternity.
        <br>
        <br>
        My contributions to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity have been recognized through various awards and nominations, 
        including being nominated for the FSL New Member Award in Spring 2022. As the Philanthropy Chairman and Community Service/
        Volunteering Chairman in Spring 2022, I organized and participated in a number of events and initiatives aimed at giving 
        back to the community and making a positive impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        Most recently, I have taken on the roles of Eminent Recorder in Fall 2022 and Eminent Herald in Spring 2023, demonstrating
         my continued commitment to serving and leading the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity. These accomplishments have not only 
         enriched my own personal growth, but have also allowed me to make a meaningful impact on the organizations and communities
          that I am a part of.
